The Bamazon Customer app lets you look up products then purchase items in Node. Simply open the folder in terminal install the npm packages with *npm install* then run *node bamazonManager.js* to get started.

The app will show all 10 products available in the Bamazon store, listed by id number. It will then ask the customer to choose which product to buy using the id number. Once that's entered, it will ask for a quantity. If we don't have that many in stock, the app informs the user of the current stock then resets. Enter *node bamazonManager.js* again to shop again.

The stock in the database will decrease if the purchase is successful, and the customer will be charged the full amount. Bamazon claims to be based in New Hampshire for tax purposes, so there's no sales tax.
